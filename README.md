ncat_httpd README
=================

# About

ncat_httpd is a HTTP/1.1 web server written entirely in Bash using ncat. It started as a project for a college class in February 2019.

ncat_http is **not** designed for use in a production environment. It is intentionally insecure and exploitable; it is designed for use as a vulnerable web server for exploitation.

# Getting Started
